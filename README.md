Video is uploaded and the requirement.txt has the libraries to be installed pip install -r requirements.txt) and use streamlit run app.py to start the UI. The UI has various options for running through each of the requirements.

What it does:
The model prompts to upload a CSV file which then runs the data profiling on it. In addition, it provides a UI to perform the required actions on the dataset

How we build it

It is build using various open source AI software and libraries

Challenges we faced:
Runtime was not sufficient to complete the execution. The issue was with Llama and mistral

Hoe to run:
